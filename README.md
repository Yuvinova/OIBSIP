This is a repository containing all the projects/tasks assigned to me while I was doing Virtual Internship Program as a Data Science Intern at Oasis InfoByte.

# TASK 1 - IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION
The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust machine learning model for the classification of Iris flowers based on their distinct features. The dataset in use comprises information regarding the sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width of Iris flowers, categorized into three classes: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica.
The dataset encompasses 150 instances, with 50 instances for each of the three classes. Notably, one class (Iris setosa) is linearly separable from the other two classes, while the latter two (Iris versicolor and Iris virginica) are not linearly separable from each other.

# TASK 2 - UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN INDIA
Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. We have seen a sharp increase in the unemployment rate during Covid 19, so analyzing the unemployment rate can be good data science project
The primary objective of this analysis is to conduct a comprehensive examination of regional unemployment rates in India without employing machine learning techniques. The dataset provides insights into unemployment dynamics, featuring key indicators such as the unemployment rate, estimated employment figures, and labor participation rates across different regions and time periods.

# TASK 3 - CAR PRICE PREDICTION
The objective of this project is to develop a robust machine learning model for predicting car prices based on relevant features. The dataset at hand contains information about various car attributes such as the year of manufacture, selling price, present price, kilometers driven, fuel type, selling type, transmission, and owner details. Leveraging this data, the goal is to create an efficient predictive model capable of estimating car prices accurately.
The problem involves regression tasks to predict the continuous variable, i.e., the selling price of cars. The developed model should be capable of generalizing well to unseen data, providing a valuable tool for estimating car prices in a dynamic market.
